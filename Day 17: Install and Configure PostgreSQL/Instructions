The Nautilus application development team has shared that they are planning to deploy one newly developed application on Nautilus infra in Stratos DC. The application uses PostgreSQL database, so as a pre-requisite we need to set up PostgreSQL database server as per requirements shared below:


PostgreSQL database server is already installed on the Nautilus database server.

a. Create a database user *kodekloud_sam* and set its password to *dCV3szSGNA*.

b. Create a database *kodekloud_db4* and grant full permissions to user *kodekloud_sam* on this database.

**Note:** Please do not try to restart PostgreSQL server service.
