The Nautilus application development team is planning to launch a new PHP-based application, which they want to deploy on Nautilus infra in Stratos DC. The development team had a meeting with the production support team and they have shared some requirements regarding the infrastructure. Below are the requirements they shared:

a. Install **nginx** on **app server 3**, configure it to use port **8092** and its document root should be **/var/www/html**.

b. Install **php-fpm** version **8.3** on **app server 3**, it must use the unix socket **/var/run/php-fpm/default.sock** (create the parent directories if don't exist).

c. Configure php-fpm and nginx to work together.

d. Once configured correctly, you can test the website using curl *http://stapp03:80982index.php* command from jump host.

**NOTE:** We have copied two files, *index.php* and *info.php*, under */var/www/html* as part of the PHP-based application setup. Please do not modify these files.
