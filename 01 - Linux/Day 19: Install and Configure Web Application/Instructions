xFusionCorp Industries is planning to host two static websites on their infra in *Stratos Datacenter*. The development of these websites is still in-progress, but we want to get the servers ready. Please perform the following steps to accomplish the task:

a. Install **httpd** package and dependencies on *app server 1*.

b. Apache should serve on port **8085**.

c. There are two website's backups **/home/thor/news** and **/home/thor/demo** on **jump_host**. Set them up on Apache in a way that **news** should work on the link **http://localhost:8085/news/** and **demo** should work on link **http://localhost:8085/demo/** on the mentioned app server.

d. Once configured you should be able to access the website using **curl** command on the respective app server, i.e **curl http://localhost:8085/news/** and **curl http://localhost:8085/demo/**
