Nautilus developers are actively working on one of the project repositories, **/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/games**. Recently, they decided to implement some new features in the application, and they want to maintain those new changes in a separate branch. Below are the requirements that have been shared with the DevOps team:

1. On *Storage server* in Stratos DC create a new branch *xfusioncorp_games* from *master* branch in */usr/src/kodekloudrepos/games* git repo.

2. Please do not try to make any changes in the code.
